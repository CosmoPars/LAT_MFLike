*LAT Multifrequency Likelihood*
=================================
External likelihood using cobaya. 

**Installating the code**
For now you will need to install cobaya by hand. Get cobaya at https://github.com/CobayaSampler/cobaya and checkout the external_modules branch. Pip install that and check that cobaya-run works (see their documentation). Then you can pip install -e this repo as well.
